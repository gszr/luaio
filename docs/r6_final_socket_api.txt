Lua socket module API
=====================

The final API for the socket module is as follows:

* Socket creation

  socket.udp(): creates a UDP socket
  socket.tcp(): creates a TCP socket
  socket.raw(): creates a RAW (IP) socket
  socket.local(): creates a local socket

* Socket manipulation

  socket:close
  socket.close(socket): closes the given socket

  socket:bind(address, port): binds the socket to an address
  socket:listen(backlog): puts the socket in listening mode
  socket:connect(address, port): set up a connection to the given address
  socket:accept(): accepts a connection; a new socket is returned
  socket:shutdown(how): shuts down a connection according to 'how'; if it
    is 'recv', disallows further receives; if it's 'send', disallows further
    transmissions; if it is 'both', disallows further transmissions and
    receptions
  socket:write(string): returns how many chars were written
  socket:read(): returns the string read and its length
