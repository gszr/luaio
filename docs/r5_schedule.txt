Schedule and Milestones
=======================

* Community bonding: Apr 23 - May 23
  Investigation of kernel APIs to be used and experimentation
  * Deliverables
    [1] Write-ups about the subsystems that were studied
    [2] Any code writte for experimentation purposes

* Generic I/O libs and bindings: May 24 - Jun 7
  Implementation of I/O libraries and bindings to kernel Lua
  * Deliverables
    [1] I/O library built on top of kernel files API, supporting regular files
        and operations that are used by other types of file supported by the
        kernel (e.g., sockets)
    [2] Kernel Lua loadable module: a loadable kernel module built on top of [1]
    [3] Port of standard Lua 'io' module: finish porting the 'io' module using
        [1]

* Sockets library and bindings (1): Jun 8 - Jun 22
  Implementation of an API for datagram (UDP) sockets
  * Deliverables
    [1] UDP sockets library built on top of kernel sockets API
    [2] Kernel Lua loadable module

* Sockets library and bindings (2): Jun 23 - Jul 7
  Implementation of an API for stream (TCP) sockets
  * Deliverables
    [1] TCP sockets library built on top of kernel sockets API
    [2] Kernel Lua loadable module

* Benchmarks: Jul 8 - Jul 31
  Develop benchmarks to kernel Lua bindings

* Polishing: Aug 1 - Aug 23
  Refactor code, review documentation, and fix any pending issues
