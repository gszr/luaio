# luaio

Welcome to my GSoC '16 project : )

I will build NetBSD kernel I/O (files and sockets) bindings for kernel Lua 
under @lneto's invaluable mentorship.

At the moment, I'm digging into NetBSD internals. I have written two reports
so far and a third will be up soon; check them out: 

* Report 1: [VFS and NetBSD VFS implementation overview](https://github.com/salazar/luaio/blob/master/r1_vfs.txt)
* Report 2: [NetBSD I/O Subsystem overview](https://github.com/salazar/luaio/blob/master/r2_io.txt)
* Report 3: NetBSD Networking Subsystem overview (soon)
