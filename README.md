# luaio

Welcome to my GSoC '16 project : )

I will build io and sockets APIs for kernel Lua under @lneto's invaluable
mentorship.

At the moment, I'm digging into NetBSD internals. I have written two reports
so far; them them out and feel free to send me feedback.

* Report 1: [VFS and NetBSD VFS implementation overview](https://github.com/salazar/luaio/blob/master/r1_vfs.txt)
* Report 2: [NetBSD I/O Subsystem overview](https://github.com/salazar/luaio/blob/master/r2_io.txt)
